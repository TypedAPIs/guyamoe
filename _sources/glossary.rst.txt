Relative URL
------------

A **relative url** is a URL that is relative to a given base. In the context of the
guya.moe API, this means URLs that are relative to the base URL of the website.
For example, if the api is located at ``https://guya.moe/api/``, then the relative
URL base is located at ``https://guya.moe``. If I have a relative URL such as ``/media/manga/Kaguya-Wants-To-Be-Confessed-To/volume_covers/25/18665.jpg``,
then the absolute URL is
``https://guya.moe/media/manga/Kaguya-Wants-To-Be-Confessed-To/volume_covers/25/18665.jpg``.
